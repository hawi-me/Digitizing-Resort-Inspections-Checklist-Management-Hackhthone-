Digitizing Resort Inspections & Checklist Management
How can we develop a digital tool to simplify and standardize inspections, allowing managers and directors to efficiently collect, track, and act on operational and physical maintenance issues across Kuriftu's resorts?

Key Focus Areas:
Mobile-friendly digital checklists for inspections (housekeeping, maintenance, F&B, etc.)
Automated issue reporting system with photo & video upload capabilities
Task assignment & follow-up tracking for corrective actions
AI-powered trend analysis to predict recurring operational challenges
